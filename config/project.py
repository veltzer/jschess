It allows yo to create a chess board, have it show games in PGN
notation from a server, moves pieces around, set up positions
and more.

Technologies used
-----------------
* Prototype javascript library at http://prototypejs.org.
* Raphael javascript library at http://raphaeljs.com.
* chess.java javascript library at https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js.

What makes jschess different?
-----------------------------
* Pure javascript.
* No images - totally scalable graphics.
* You can have your board at any size you want (because of scalable graphics).
* As a result of being pure javascript totally controllable programatically.
* Looks best.
* Sits on top of good infrastructure (prototype.js,raphael.js,chess.js).
