 What makes jschess different?
 -----------------------------
 * Pure javascript.
 * No images - totally scalable graphics.
 * You can have your board at any size you want (because of scalable graphics).
 * As a result of being pure javascript totally controllable programatically.
 * Looks best.
 * Sits on top of good infrastructure (prototype.js,raphael.js,chess.js).
