JavaScript based chess board

jschess is a JavaScript chess board written in pure JavaScript.
It allows yo to create a chess board, have it show games in PGN
notation from a server, moves pieces around, set up positions
and more.

Technologies used
-----------------
* Prototype javascript library (http://prototypejs.org).
* Raphael javascript library (http://raphaeljs.com).
* chess.java javascript library (https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js).

Demo
----
Is at my machine at (https://veltzer.net/jschess).

What makes jschess different?
-----------------------------
* Pure javascript.
* No images - totally scalable graphics.
* You can have your board at any size you want (because of scalable graphics).
* As a result of being pure javascript totally controllable programatically.
* Looks best.
* Sits on top of good infrastructure (prototype.js,raphael.js,chess.js).

Monetary contribution

I am ready to work with any chess organization wishing to incorporate jschess
into their infrastructre and am already working with two such organizations...
