## build

![build](https://github.com/veltzer/jschess/workflows/build/badge.svg)

jschess is a JavaScript chess board written in pure JavaScript.
It allows yo to create a chess board, have it show games in PGN
notation from a server, moves pieces around, set up positions
and more.

Technologies used
-----------------
* Prototype javascript library at http://prototypejs.org.
* Raphael javascript library at http://raphaeljs.com.
* chess.java javascript library at https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js.

What makes jschess different?
-----------------------------
* Pure javascript.
* No images - totally scalable graphics.
* You can have your board at any size you want (because of scalable graphics).
* As a result of being pure javascript totally controllable programatically.
* Looks best.
* Sits on top of good infrastructure (prototype.js,raphael.js,chess.js).

Monetary contribution
---------------------
If you'd like to see a feature added to jschess or would just like to show
your appreciation you are welcome to contribute to it's development on it's website.

I am ready to work with any chess organization wishing to incorporate jschess
into their infrastructre and am already working with two such organizations...
